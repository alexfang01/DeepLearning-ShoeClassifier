# Deep Learning - Shoe Type Classifier

This repository contains code and resources for training a deep learning model to classify different types of shoes using the **ShoeTypeClassifierDataset**. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict the type of shoe based on images.

## Dataset from Kaggle.com

The dataset, **ShoeTypeClassifierDataset**, consists of images of various types of shoes, categorized into different classes. The dataset is hosted externally (e.g., Google Drive, AWS S3, Kaggle), and the download link is provided below.
